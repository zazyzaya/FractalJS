# WebGL Base Project

I have found that 90% of getting physics sims running correctly is fiddling with WebGL's annoyingness. This project does that for me, so in the future I can just fork this and use it for other stuff. 
Just go in and update the `get_colors` function, and you're off to the races. Everything else will just render.
